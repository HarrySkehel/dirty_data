The dataset was made up of 3 separate tables, one for each year from 2015 to 2017. There were many differences in the tables including numbers of columns and formatting of column names.

The cleaning on 2015 is being used as an example as much of the cleaning on the 2016 and 2017 were similar.

As the formatting of the column headings was varied, the desiered columns were renamed in a similar format so required columns could be pulled out by pattern.
```{reval=FALSE}
colnames(candy_2015)[1] = "[timestamp]"
colnames(candy_2015)[2] = "[age]"
colnames(candy_2015)[3] = "[going_out]"

cleanish_2015 <- candy_2015[, grep("^(\\[)", names(candy_2015))]
```

An ID column was also added to all the tables which would continue across each table instead of going back to 1 when the next table begins.

```{reval=FALSE}
cleanish_2015[, "long_id"] <- c(1:5630)

even_cleaner_2016[, "long_id"] <- c(5631:6889)

cleaner_2017[, "long_id"] <- c(6890:9349)
```

Tables pivoted longer to have "candy_type" as a column heading with each different candy type as observations.The ratings are now also contained in one column.

```{reval=FALSE}
long_2015 <- cleanish_2015 %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = (4:98), 
               names_to = "candy_type",
               values_to = "rating")
```


A added "source" column to allow data to be identified by original data once tables are merged.

```{reval=FALSE}
long_2015[, "source"] <- "2015"
```

Tables all in the same order are merged together.
```{reval=FALSE}
candy_all_years <- bind_rows(ready_to_merge_2015, ready_to_merge_2016, ready_to_merge_2017)
```

By calculating the number of NAs across the columns, the dataset could be slightly shrunk as any rows with 5 NAs could be removed as it meant none of the questions had been answered.
```{reval=FALSE}

candy_all_years <- candy_all_years %>% 
  mutate(total_NAs = apply(., MARGIN = 1, function(x) sum(is.na(x))))

candy_all_years <- candy_all_years %>% 
  filter(total_NAs != 5)

```

As "country" column was extremely varied in contents, variables were made to create patterns for detection in the column. The values in the columns were mutated accordingly.
```{reval=FALSE}
pattern_us <- "'merica|merica|america|usa|us|u.s.|us|state|u s|u.s.a|trump|united|murica|murrika
                |amerca|new york|california|new jersey|alaska|yoo ess"
pattern_uk <- "endland|england|scotland|dom|u.k.|ireland"

pattern_canada <- "canada|canada`"


candy_all_countries <- candy_all_years %>% 
  mutate(
    country = case_when(
      str_detect(country, pattern_uk) ~ "uk",
      str_detect(country, pattern_us) ~ "usa",
      str_detect(country, pattern_canada) ~ "canada",
      TRUE ~ "Other"
    )
  )
```






Questions to be answered.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

candy <- read_csv(here("clean_data/clean_candy.csv"), guess_max = 800000)
```


```{r}
# Question 1 - What is the total number of candy ratings given across the three years. (number of candy ratings, not number of raters. Donâ€™t count missing values)


candy %>% 
  summarise(number_of_ratings = sum(!is.na(rating)))
  
```
```{r}
# Question 2 - What was the average age of people who are going out trick or treating and the average age of people 3. not going trick or treating?

candy %>% 
  select(going_out, age) %>% 
  group_by(going_out) %>% 
  summarise(average_age = median(age, na.rm = TRUE))


```

```{r} 
# Question 3 - For each of joy, despair and meh, which candy bar revived the most of these ratings?

candy %>% 
  group_by(rating, candy_type) %>% 
  summarise(number_ratings = n()) %>% 
  slice_max(number_ratings)

  

```


```{r}
# Question 4 - How many people rated Starburst as despair?

candy %>% 
  filter(rating == "DESPAIR") %>% 
  filter(candy_type == "starburst") %>% 
  summarise(number_of_ratings = n())
```

```{r}
# number ratings - for questions 5,6 & 7

candy_by_numbers <- candy %>%
  mutate(
    rating = case_when(
      rating == "JOY"     ~ 1,
      rating == "MEH"     ~ 0,
      rating == "DESPAIR" ~ -1,
      TRUE                ~ as.numeric(rating)
    ))
  

```


```{r}
# Question 6 -What was the most popular candy bar by this rating system for each gender in the dataset?


candy_by_numbers %>% 
  group_by(gender, candy_type) %>% 
  summarise(total_ratings = sum(rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  slice_max(total_ratings)


```
```{r}
# Quesiton 7 - What was the most popular candy bar in each year?
candy_by_numbers %>% 
  group_by(source, candy_type) %>% 
  summarise(total_ratings = sum(rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  slice_max(total_ratings)

```
```{r}
# Question 8 - What was the most popular candy bar by this rating for people in US, Canada, UK and all other countries?
candy_by_numbers %>%
