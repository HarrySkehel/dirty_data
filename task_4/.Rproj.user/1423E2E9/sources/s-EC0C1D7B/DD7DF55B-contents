The dataset in question contains athletes results from the differnet events in a decathelon as well as there competiton rank and score. 
Each event is a different variable as well as the competitons "Olympic" and "Descastar" having their own columns. Each observation is the result for an individual athlete.


Cleaning the data:

The row names were removed and made into a column called "competitor"

```{r eval=FALSE}
decath_data_clean <- rownames_to_column(decath_data, "Competitor") %>% 
  clean_names()
```

The dataset was then pivoted longer to contain one varialbe "event". The "points" and "rank" columns were also renamed to specify that they were relative to the cempetition.
Columns were also move, move for asthetics than functionality.

```{r eval=FALSE}
decath_data_clean <- decath_data_clean %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(2:11), 
               names_to = "event",
               values_to = "result") %>% 
  rename(competiton_rank = rank, competition_points = points) %>% 
  relocate(event, result, .before = competiton_rank)
```

Finally the competitor names were all made lower case as there were instances where the cases were different between competitons. 
The clean data was written to a .csv file

```{r eval=FALSE}
decath_clean <- decath_data_clean %>% 
  mutate(competitor = str_to_lower(competitor))
  

write_csv(decath_clean, "clean_data/decath_clean.csv")

```


Analysis Questions 

Quesiton 1 - Who had the longest long jump seen in the data?

```{r}
decath_clean %>% 
  filter(event == "long_jump") %>% 
  slice_max(result, n = 1)
```
Question 2 - What was the average 100m time in each competition?

```{r}
decath_clean %>% 
  select(result, event, competition) %>% 
  group_by(competition) %>% 
  filter(event == "x100m") %>% 
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), mean))
```
Question 3 - Who had the highest total points across both competitions?

```{r}
decath_clean %>% 
  group_by(competitor, competition_points) %>% 
  summarise() %>% 
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), sum)) %>% 
  slice_max(competition_points)
```

Question 4 - What was the shot-put scores for the top three competitors in each competition?

```{r}
decath_clean %>% 
  filter(event == "shot_put") %>% 
  group_by(competition) %>% 
  slice_max(result, n = 3)
```

Question 5 - What was the average points for competitors who ran the 400m in less than 50 seconds vs. those than ran 400m in more than 50 seconds?

```{r}
decath_clean %>% 
  filter(event == "x400m") %>% 
  group_by(result <= 50) %>% 
  summarise(avg_points = mean(competition_points))
```
